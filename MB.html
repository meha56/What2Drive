            <p class="model-details-Coupe" onclick="hideShow();">The AMG GT Coupé is an 4-seater luxurious sports car with performance
            seats made in fine Nappa Leather and can be easily driven on a road or race track. It has aluminium steering 
          wheel gearshift paddles and convenient AMG buttons on the steering wheel. It also offers 2 AMG 5-twin-spoke design,
        light-alloy wheels. <br><br>
          Review: <br>
          The sports car is easy and smooth to drive while in comfortable seats. However, the back 2 seats in the car do not offer
          as much space and can get cramped for taller passengers or depending on the amount of luggage. However, it provides good
          sceens, menus and dynamic control dials. Although depending on the series, it can cost from $170,000 - $400,000, owning
          a mercedes can be more reliable and trustworthy to take care of than a Ferrari or Porsche. Therefore, although the 
          GT Coupé is extremely expensive and can get cramped in the back seats, it gives comfort and reliability for a high-end car.

            <p class="model-details-GLE" onclick="hideShow1();">The Mercedes GLE-Class SUV is a powerful and sporty SUV. It presents
            a bright panoramic sliding sunroof and a high level of comfort in the ambiance and seats. It also offers
          the MBUX multimedia system with intuitive operations by voice, touch or gestures. The SUV is also 
        extremely high-tech with a head-up display, USB ports and a Burmester Surround Sound System implemented. <br><br>
          Review: <br>
          The GLE-Class SUV is extremely aesthetic and visually appealing, with numerous implementations of modern technology 
          and is equipped with an optional air suspension that can provide increased ground clearance. In terms of cost, the 
          GLE-Class is also more affordable, starting from around $60,000 USD. However, it offers a limited warranty and Mercedes
          offers no complementary maintainence compared to its counterparts BMW or Porsche. Therefore, although the Mercedes GLE-Class
          SUV has various modern features and is extremely well-designed, it's maintainance for the future should also be considered.

            <p class="model-details-e-class" onclick="hideShow2();">The E-Class Sedan is a progressive design with power domes, 
            restyled head lamps and modern wheel designs. It's dynamic front section is exquisite and stylish and the design implements
          a panoramic sliding sunroof. The interiors provide a digital cockpit and MBUX, a wide screen cockpit, ambient lighting 
        with 64 different colors to create numerous color themes and a multifunctioning steering wheel in nappa leather. <br><br>
        Review: <br>
        The exterior of the E-Class Sedan has a strong personality and a visually appealing design. On the road it is subtle, yet 
        strong and has good LED headlights. However, the interiors of the car are it's highlight and it is full of the latest technology
        and the seats are designed to address the comfort of passengers. In terms of cost, it can range from $120,000 - $150,000, but
        is extremely spacious. Therefore, although the E-Class Sedan might be slightly more expensive, it addresses comfort, 
        aesthetics, technology and safety all in one design.
