                <p class="model-details-GR-Supra" onclick="hideShow();">The Toyota GR-Supra is an agile and powerful sportscar
                and multiple award winner (Drive Sports Car of the Year 2020 and West Wheels Sports Car of the Year 2019). 
              It offers various unique color choices and both GT and GTS grades. Additionally, it has finely tuned aerodynamics
            and adaptive six lens headlights. In the interior, it provides a MID Instrument Display, advanced color touchscreen
          and advanced safety technology. <br><br>
            Review: <br>
            From the interior, the GR-Supra implements a high standard of usability in technology with its high resolution 
            touch screen interface, embedded satellite navigation and buttons conveniently placed near the steering wheel. 
            Additionally, everything is elegantly finished in a gloss carbon-firbre which seperates this car from the rest. 
            Although this car can go extremely fast, it may not be suitable to be driven just in the city. Furthermore,
            it can cost between $85,000 - $110,000. Therefore, 
            the GR Supra offers many features of a sports car at an affordable price but may not be suitable depending on 
            use of the car.

                The RAV4-Prime is Toyota's electric SUV with a hybrid battery warranty. On the exterior, it has an unique 
                front end and uses two-tone paint to elevate the style and aesthetics. On the interior each of the seats 
                are wrapped in premium SofTex-trimmed material to emphasise comfort and there is a premium leather trim to 
                give the SUV a sporty look. Additionally, there is a panoramic sliding glass roof and ambient lighting options. <br><br>
                Review: <br>
                Since the SUV is an electric car, it is sustainable and only requires 4.5 hours of charging time for a long 
              all electric driving range. Additionally, it is extremely comfortable and is spacious for passengers and to keep luggage.
              However, the steering wheel lacks the convenience and comfort compared to the other cars.

                On the exterior, every line and surface has been shaped to redefine this sedan and the flared wheels arche to 
              enhance it's sporty look. On the interior, it implements ambient lighting, 1 year of complementary access to Toyota
            Connected Services, a head-up display, keyless entry and a touch screen multimedia. It also uses modern features such as 
          active cruise control, lane trace assist, wpeed limit warnings, a reversing camera and passive SRS airbags. <br><br>
          Review: <br>
            Toyota's Corolla Sedan tries to create a new style of sedan's with its unique shape and design. It requires limited
          fuel consumption in prime conditions and is easy to drive even over rough bumps. Additionally, it is extremely spacious
           and has a large trunk. However, the desing isn't too visually appealing and there are no parking sensors or folding mirrors.
          Therefore, the Corolla Sedan is good for someone looking for a spacious, comfortable and affordable car which is easy to maintain.</p>
