        rear-wheel drive, premium unleaded petrol and a 2 seat configuration. <br><br>
          Review:<br>The minimalistic sports car look and macho Gunmental Grey 17-inch BBS forged
        alloy wheels make the Mazda MX-5 an aesthetic model. However, the MX-5 is a very small sportscar and 
        can be tight, especially for anyone over six-feet, but may be preferable
      if you are looking to drive solo. The fuel efficiency is great for a sports car and it includes four airbags(dual and
    front side) alongside other safety systems. Overall, Mazda MX-5's are one of the finest sports cars on the market and 
  is the perfect in terms of affordability and packaging for someone who prioritises drives.</p>

        <p class="model-details-CX-5" onclick="hideShow1();">Offers comfortable room for five people, ergonomic seats that
        support the curvature in your back and is crafted to capture light and reflect its surrounding environment. <br><br>
      Review: <br>The CX-5 comes with a plethora of specifications such as front wheel drive, all wheel drive, three 
    petrol engines and a diesel. The CX-5 includes six airbags for safety alongside a speed limiter and other safety technology 
  and the seats are heated. Although it includes two cup holders, a charging mat and a decent cabin size, the colors of the 
interiors of the CX-5 are not as lifting or aesthetic as other models or brands. On the road the CX-5 is a super relaxed car and 
delivers a swift and smooth drive. In conclusion, the Mazda CX-5 gives plenty of luxury and comfort for someone looking for 
a calm interior, smooth looks and a subtly powerful engine. </p>

        <h3 class="model-hide-show" onclick="hideShow2();">details <i class="fa fa-caret-down"></i></h3>
        <p class="model-details-Mazda6-Sedan" onclick="hideShow2();">Offers an 8-inch full color touch screen display, 
        474 liters of cargo room, 2.5 liter petrol engine and a 2.5 liter petrol turbo engine. <br><br>
      Review: <br>
      The Mazda 6 offers a medium sized passenger sedan rivaling the Volkswagen Passat and Toyota Camry. The aesthetics of the sedan may 
      not be as high tech or stylish as its other designs, however, its simplistic design thrives in darker colors such as black or blue.
      The simplistic style also transfers to the button design and makes it easy and convenient to meddle with. 
      Additionally, the Mazda 6 provides a comfortable amount of leg room and space for tall passengers or drivers, specifically in the front.
      Furthermore, it grants 2 USB-A ports, an auxillary input, two cup-holders and a wireless phone charger. Although, its display is only 
      touch-enables when the car is still, the sedan still implements the 11-speaker Bose systems and Apple Carplay. In conclusion, 
      although the design of the Mazda6 Sedan isn't as modern as other designs, it provides a plethora of utilities and can be incredibly 
      aesthetic in certain colors.
